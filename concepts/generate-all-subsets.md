# Generate all subsets
Find all the subsets of a given set.

Input: 
`S = {a, b, c, d}`

Output:
```
{}, {a} , {b}, {c}, {d}, {a,b}, {a,c}, {a,d}, {b,c}, {b,d}, {c,d}, {a,b,c}, {a,b,d}, {a,c,d}, {b,c,d}, {a,b,c,d}
```

The total number of subsets of any given set is equal to 2^ (no. of elements in the set). If we carefully notice it is nothing but binary numbers from 0 to 15 which can be shown as below:

```
0000	{}
0001	{a}
0010	{b}
0011	{a, b}
0100	{c}
0101	{a, c}
0110	{b, c}
0111	{a, b, c}
1000	{d}
1001	{a, d}
1010	{b, d}
1011	{a, b, d}
1100	{c, d}
1101	{a, c, d}
1110	{b, c, d}
1111	{a, b, c, d}
```

Starting from right, 1 at ith position shows that the ith element of the set is present as 0 shows that the element is absent. Therefore, what we have to do is just generate the binary numbers from 0 to 2^n â€“ 1, where n is the length of the set or the numbers of elements in the set.
