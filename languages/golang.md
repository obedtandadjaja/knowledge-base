# Golang

Golang is a fast, compiled, garbage-collected, concurrent systems programming language. Golang was created as a future-proof language to meet the challenges of the present and anticipate challenges of the future.

Advantages:
- Compiles large projects within a few seconds
- Open source by nature so defects will be detected and eliminated faster
- Fast since it has simple structure and syntax. It is devoid of classes and type inheritance. The language is based on functions, so it is simple and fast to learn. It’s compiled so it provides faster feedback, shorter time to market, and saves time and money.  It’s simple, so it is more maintainable, and development is faster and cheaper.
- Concurrent in nature with the help of goroutines, channels, and garbage collection
- Cross-platform
- Statically typed so developers have to be more accurate and attentive, so the code is neater and safer

Disadvantages:
- Less flexible copared to other dynamically typed languages
- Lack of 3rd party modules
- Differs a lot from C-based languages
- Has no generics (generics allow writing code which can be reusable - it saves time and effort in some cases)

## Commands

### go build

- Compiles packages and dependencies
- Go build ignores files whose names start with `_` or `.`
- By default the executable will be generated in the same folder. If you want the file to be generated in `$GOPATH/bin` then use `go install` instead
- `go build` will compile all the files in the folder, if you just want to compile one file then use `go build <file_path>`

## go clean

- Cleans files that are generated by compilers
- Do this before pushing a commit to Github

## go fmt

- Enforces go code formatting to the project. It will rewrite the source files after formatting code

## go get

- Fetches remote packages. Currently only supports BitBucket, Github, Google Code, and Launchpad
- Does the following actions: downloads the source code, then executes `go install`

## go install

- Compiles all packages and generates files, then moves them to `$GOPATH/pkg` or `$GOPATH/bin`

## go test

- Loads all files whose name include `*_test.go` and generates test files, then prints information about the test results
- Tests all your test files by default

## go fix

- Upgrades from an older version to newer version of golang

## go list

- Lists all installed packages

## go run

- Compiles temporary files and run the application
