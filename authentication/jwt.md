# JWT (JSON Web Token)
JWT is one method for allowing authentication, without actually storing any information about the user on the system itself (as opposed to session based authentication [session based authentication](https://www.sohamkamani.com/blog/2018/03/25/golang-session-authentication/)).

JSON Web Tokens are an open, industry standard RFC 7519 method for representing claims securely between two parties.

## JWT Format

JWT consists of 3 parts separated by `.`.

The header and payload are not `encrypted`. They are just base64 encoded. This means that anyone can view their contents by decoding them.

```
echo <base64 encoded string> | base64 -D
```

### Header
The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm being used, such as `HMAC`, `SHA256` or `RSA`.

### Payload
The second part of the token is the payload, which contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. There are three types of claims: registered, public, and private claims.

Registered claims: These are a set of predefined claims which are not mandatory but recommended, to provide a set of useful, interoperable claims. Some of them are: `iss` (issuer), `exp` (expiration time), `sub` (subject), `aud` (audience), and [others](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1).

Notice that the claim names are only three characters long as JWT is meant to be compact.

Public claims: These can be defined at will by those using JWTs. But to avoid collisions they should be defined in the [IANA JSON Web Token Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml) or be defined as a URI that contains a collision resistant namespace.

Private claims: These are the custom claims created to share information between parties that agree on using them and are neither registered or public claims.

### Signature
To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.

## How it works

### Generation
The application issuing the token will have a secret key, which will be combined with the header and payload and then passed through a hashing function to produce the signature.

Because hashes can never be reversed, our secret key is safe from being sent publicly.

### Verifying
Get the header and payload data and hash them together with the secret key. If the result matches the signature then we are confident that the token was generated by the same application.

## When should you use JWT
`Authorization`: This is the most common scenario for using JWT. Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token. Single Sign On is a feature that widely uses JWT nowadays, because of its small overhead and its ability to be easily used across different domains.

`Information Exchange`: JSON Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties. Because JWTs can be signed—for example, using public/private key pairs—you can be sure the senders are who they say they are. Additionally, as the signature is calculated using the header and the payload, you can also verify that the content hasn't been tampered with.

## Why JWT?
How does JSON Web Tokens (JWT) compare to Simple Web Tokens (SWT) and Security Assertion Markup Language Tokens (SAML)?

As JSON is less verbose than XML, when it is encoded its size is also smaller, making JWT more compact than SAML. This makes JWT a good choice to be passed in HTML and HTTP environments.

Security-wise, SWT can only be symmetrically signed by a shared secret using the HMAC algorithm. However, JWT and SAML tokens can use a public/private key pair in the form of a X.509 certificate for signing. Signing XML with XML Digital Signature without introducing obscure security holes is very difficult when compared to the simplicity of signing JSON.

JSON parsers are common in most programming languages because they map directly to objects. Conversely, XML doesn't have a natural document-to-object mapping. This makes it easier to work with JWT than SAML assertions.

Regarding usage, JWT is used at Internet scale. This highlights the ease of client-side processing of the JSON Web token on multiple platforms, especially mobile.
