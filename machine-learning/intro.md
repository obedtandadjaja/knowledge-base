Diagram showing the relationships between AI, ML, deep learning, and data science.

Machine learning is the creation of automated systems that can learn hidden patters from data to aid in making intelligent decisions.

## Fairness

Data can be manipulated to support any conclusion -- unbiasing needs to be performed.

Fairness-related harms:

- Allocation: one class is favored over another
- Quality of service: data is trained on a specific scenario that does not reflect reality
- Stereotyping: association of group with pre-assigned attributes
- Denigration: unfairly criticize and label something
- Over- or under- representation: certain group is not seen in certain features

[Fairlearn](https://fairlearn.org/) is an open-source Python package that allows you to assess your systems' fairness and mitigate unfairness.

## Jargons

- Feature is a measurable property of your data.
- Target is a thing you are trying to predict.
- Epochs are iterations of training.
- Model fitting refers to the accuracy of the model's underlying function as it attempts to analyze data with which it is not familiar.
- Underfitting is when the model is not accurate.
- Overfitting is when the model is too accurate because it has learned the data's details and noise too well.
- Parameter tuning is tweaking a model's hyperparameters.
