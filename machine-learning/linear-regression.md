Linear approach to modelling the relationship between scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (dependent and independent variables). One explanatory variable = simple linear regression, two or more explanatory variable = multiple linear regression.

Given a data set of n statistical units, a linear regression model assumes that the relationship between dependent variable y and the p-vector of regssors x is linear. This relationship is modeled through a disturbance term - an unobserved random variable that adds "noise" to the linear relationship between the variables

Linear regression models are often fitted using the least squares approach.

## Practical uses

1. Prediction, forecasting, error reduction:
    1. Used to fit a predictive model to an observed data set of values of the response and explanatory variables
    1. The fitted model then can be used to make prediction of responses given an explanatory variable
1. Explain variation in the response variable that can be attributed to variation in the explanatory variables. Linear regression analysis can be applied to quantify the strength of the relationship, and identify if there is such relationship at all.

## Least squares

Minimizes the sum of squared residuals (difference between an observed value, and the fitted value provided by a model) made in the results of every single equation.
