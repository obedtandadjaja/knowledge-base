# Kafka

Apache Kafka is a publish-subscribe based durable messaging system.

Brief history.

Apache Kafka was the creation of former LinkedIn data engineers. In 2011, the technology was handed over to the open-source community as a highly scalable messaging system.

What is it used for?

Systems are incredibly complex today -- in particular, data and logs are plenty and they need to be processed, reprocessed, analyzed and handled - often in realtime. Apache Kafka is playing a significant role in the message streaming landscape.
