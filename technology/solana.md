# Solana

Solana is a cryptocurrency built with low gas-fees and performance in mind.

On Solana, programs are "stateless", which is different from Ethereum where you write smart contracts that stores data on variables directly on contracts. Solana has accounts owned by users and Solana programs just interact with these accounts. This means that the program itself does not hold user data, but just talks to accounts that hold user data.

[Blockchain bridges](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-bridges) can be used by two diverse chains to communicate with each other. This means that an Ethereum NFT could be transferred over to Solana.
