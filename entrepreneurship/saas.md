# SaaS

Software as a Service

## Is the idea sound?

Figure out a quick elevator pitch for your idea. Narrow down what exact problem you are trying to solve. How does that help people?

Verbalize that idea. Talk to yourself and determine if it is something you would buy?

Talk to your friends and get some quick validations from them whether or not the idea makes sense.

Go over questions in https://jamescun.github.io/iPG/. Do not take too long thinking about an idea; sometimes working on it then pivoting is a better choice.

## How to gauge interest?

1. Create a landing page for your idea. The landing page can be made via no-code website builders like WordPress or Typedream.
1. Create a waitlist for the app.
1. Set up SEO and small ads budget to see if there are interests from the public.
