# SEO

**SEO = Give users what they want. There is no substitute for creating great content.**

- Content that answers the user's questions.
- Content structured in a logical format. Easy for user to find what they need
- Well written content and easy to read

Google's job is to give the best result that will satisfy user's intent. Your job is to create that result.

In the recent years, there is an influx in bogus articles/webpages made for crawlers and not necessarily the user. Google's algorithm is set to rank articles that benefit the user most higher instead of articles that are specifically configured for crawlers.

**SEO is about playing the long game**

- Very little instant gratification.
- Ranking for keywords could happen in 2 weeks to 6 months.
- Betting on the future value of keywords and search phrases.

## Basics

### Keywords

Words, phrases, questions used by target user when they type into the search box

- Short tail
  - High volume
  - High competition
  - Difficult to rank
  - Less specific
- Long tail
  - Low volume
  - Lesser competition
  - Easier to rank
  - Very specific

### Search intent

What is the user hoping to find when they make a search?

Common intents:

- Find broad information regarding a topic

### Content Types

Based on the keywords discovered and search intent identified, what kind of content should you create that will satisfy the userâ€™s need?

### Funnel stages

Which part of the buyer journey is the user at, when making a particular type of search?

- BOFU - bottom of the funnel
  - User's intent is to buy or start using a solution
  - Examples:
    - Best podcast hosting app
    - Buy jasmine tea
    - Habit tracker app
- MOFU - middle of the funnel
  - User is aware of your product, but they aren't convinced about your product's quality or your credibility
  - This content ideally drives the user to make a final buying decision
  - Examples:
    - How X increased viewership by Y% using ABC podcast hosting app
    - Customer Review: Drinking jasmine tea before bed helped achieving weight loss
    - Study: People using a habit tracker app 3x likelier to stick to habits
- TOFU - top of the funnel
  - User is part of your broad target audience. They may not know about your product or need it yet
  - This content introduces new users to your website, product, or brand.
  - Examples:
    - Best Health & Fitness podcasts of 2021
    - 7 types of tea that can help with weight loss
    - How to break bad habits

### On-Page SEO

- H1 / H2 / H3 or other headings
- Keyword density (how often a keyword is used)
- Length of content
- Readability
- External links
- Page load times
- Bounce rates

### Off-Page SEO

- Meta tag - title, description, open graph image
- Internal linking

### Backlink

- It's a signal to Google about the value of your website
- Tools like Ahrefs assign DR (Domain Rating) score. Higher is better

## Programmatic SEO Framework

A methodological approach to finding keywords, understanding user intent, and creating hundreds of landing pages.

### 1. Identify

Find a pattern of repeatable search phrases. The pattern should yield hundreds, if not thousands of phrases.

E.g. "How to make X". X is type of tea.

Evaluate your competition and gauge whether you can win.

1. How good is their content?
1. How competitive is the search term?
1. Do existing first page results have high domain authority and backlinks?

If you competition is really strong, you are unlikely to beat them especially with a new website. Better to continue your research than try to take them on.

### 2. Experiment

1. Create 3-5 pages targeting search phrases from the pattern.
1. Submit updated sitemap on Google Search Console.
1. Wait for 2-4 weeks.

At this stage, create content as fast as possible. You want to create content that is just good enough at this phase.

One experiment should not take more than 1 day.

How to create quality content?

- Quality content = Answer's the user's intent
- Well-written and easy to read
- Structured properly allowing user to find what they need quickly

### 3. Double down

After 2-4 weeks, if your pages start showing positive initial results, then it's time to double down.

Positive initial results:

1. Impressions and clicks to the pages in Search Console.
1. Showing up somewhere on pages 1-5 in Google.

How to double down:

1. Create more pages for your repeatable search phrase.
1. Improve content quality - comprehensive, easy-to-read, well structured.
1. Internal linking
1. Backlinks to the page

### 3. Move On

No signs of life?

1. If you believe in the idea, create a few more pages and repeat.
1. If not, find a repeatable search phrase.

Possible reasons why experiment failed:

1. Existing content is high quality
1. Highly competitive short-tail search terms
1. Existing results have tons of backlinks and high domain authority
